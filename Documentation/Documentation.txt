Code Tutor Notes

Parceable:-Android Recomends using Parceable instead of Serializable intterface for passing custom objects.
Reason:-Parceable is much faster(almost 2 times ) faster in marshalling and unmarshalling compared to serializable.

Steps to implement Parceable
----------------------------
1)Let the bean class implement Parceable interface
2)Define overloaded constrictor for the bean class which has parcel as argument.
3)implement method for parceable interface.
    a)describe contents.
    b)writeToParcel(Parcel out,int flags)
    c)Create a non-null static filed called CREATOR of a type that implements the Parceable.creator interface.
